///         to the most recently created off-chain ECDSA wallets of the tBTC Bridge
///         using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) or pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH)
///         containing hashed information about this Depositor contract address,
///         and deposit owner's Ethereum address.
///         Then, the deposit owner initiates tBTC minting by revealing their Ethereum
///         address along with their deposit blinding factor, refund public key
///         hash and refund locktime on the tBTC Bridge through this Depositor
///         contract.
///         The off-chain ECDSA wallet and Optimistic Minting bots listen for these
///         sorts of messages and when they get one, they check the Bitcoin network
///         to make sure the deposit lines up. Majority of tBTC minting is finalized
///         by the Optimistic Minting process, where Minter bot initializes
///         minting process and if there is no veto from the Guardians, the
///         process is finalized and tBTC minted to the Depositor address. If
///         the revealed deposit is not handled by the Optimistic Minting process
///         the off-chain ECDSA wallet may decide to pick the deposit transaction
///         for sweeping, and when the sweep operation is confirmed on the Bitcoin
///         network, the tBTC Bridge and tBTC vault mint the tBTC token to the
///         Depositor address. After tBTC is minted to the Depositor, on the deposit
