# Acre dApp

The application is compatible with Ledger Live and allows people to earn yield on their Bitcoin via yield farming on Ethereum.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

## Quickstart

Install dependencies and start the app.

 ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn start
```

Once the build is running, you can import the manifest on desktop:

1. [Install Ledger Live Desktop](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live)
2. Enable the Developer mode

    Go to the **Settings -> About** section, and click 10 times on the Ledger Live version. A new Developer section appears in the settings menu. Turn on **Enable platform dev** tools to use the developer tools window to inspect your app.
3. Add your manifest

    Click on Browse next to **Add a local app** and select the manifest file. The app is now visible in the menu.
