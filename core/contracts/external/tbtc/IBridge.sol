/// @title Bitcoin Bridge
/// @notice Bridge manages BTC deposit and redemption flow and is increasing and
///         decreasing balances in the Bank as a result of BTC deposit and
///         redemption operations performed by depositors and redeemers.
///
///         Depositors send BTC funds to the most recently created off-chain
///         ECDSA wallet of the bridge using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) or
///         pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) containing hashed information
///         about the depositorâ€™s Ethereum address. Then, the depositor reveals
///         their Ethereum address along with their deposit blinding factor,
///         refund public key hash and refund locktime to the Bridge on Ethereum
///         chain. The off-chain ECDSA wallet listens for these sorts of
///         messages and when it gets one, it checks the Bitcoin network to make
///         sure the deposit lines up. If it does, the off-chain ECDSA wallet
///         may decide to pick the deposit transaction for sweeping, and when
///         the sweep operation is confirmed on the Bitcoin network, the ECDSA
///         wallet informs the Bridge about the sweep increasing appropriate
///         balances in the Bank.
/// @dev Bridge is an upgradeable component of the Bank. The order of
///      functionalities in this contract is: deposit, sweep, redemption,
///      moving funds, wallet lifecycle, frauds, parameters.
