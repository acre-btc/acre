## Development

### Pre-commit Hooks

Developers are encouraged to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to
automatically discover code issues, before they submit the code.

To setup the hooks follow the steps:

1. Install `pre-commit` tool:
    ```sh
    brew install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the hooks for the repository:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```
